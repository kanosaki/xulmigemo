All done!
All goes as right as a trivet
All good things come to an end
All his geese are swans

All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
All's fair in love and war
All's well that ends well

He foiled her
He had the cheek to propose to me
He jeered at me
He persuaded her to marry him
He that cannot ask cannot love
He that does nothing does ever amiss
He who hates Peter harms his dogs
He who hesitates is lost
He who hurts another hurts himself
He who makes no mistakes makes nothing
He who pays the piper calls the tune
He's all thumbs
He's clumsy
He's not so green as he looks
He's the very spit of his father

It beats me
ItBeats me
It can't be helped
It goes against one's

It goes without saying that
needless to say
It is a known fact that
It is a long road that has no turning
It is a safe bet that
It is against the law to
It is better to do nothing than to do something dumb
It is better to give than to take
It is in A as in B
AB
It is likely that
It is needless to say that
It goes without saying that
It is no exaggeration to say that
It is no use crying over spilt milk
It is no wonder
that
It is no wonder that
No wonder that
It is risky to put all your eggs in one basket
It is safe to say that
It is a safe bet that
It is the practice to

It is uncouth
It is unlikely that
It is unlikely that this situation will improve in the near term
It never rains but it pours
It rains in some places
It runs deeper than that
It stand to reason that
It takes all sorts to make a world
It turns out that
It won't happen again
It worked
It works for me
Sounds good
It would be more accurate to say
that
It's a shame
It's an ill wind that blows nobody

It's as plain as ABC
It's fun ing
It's incredible!
It's never too late to learn
It's no trouble at all
It's not a big problem
It's not that
It's sometimes necessary to stretch the truth
It's supposed to rain at night
It's the thought that counts
It's up to you
Up to you
It's very inviting

You can't get anythig for nothing
You can't get blood out of a stone
You can't go against the laws of nature
You can't have your cake and eat it too
You can't take it with you when you die
You cannot eat your cake and have it too
You cannot teach an old dog new tricks
You don't mean to say ?
You have to
